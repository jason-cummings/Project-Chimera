A basic 3D platformer game with a toon shading style.

## Usage
### Mac/Linux
Ensure that you have CMake version 3.6+ installed on the command line, then build the project by executing:
```
./scripts/cmake-make.sh
```

Then run the game executable with:
```
./bin/bin/projectchimera
```

### Windows
Using the CMake GUI, enter ```[full path to project]``` in the "Where is the source code:" field, and enter ```[full path to project]/bin``` in the "Where to build the binaries:" field. Then press the "Configure" and "Generate" buttons to generate a Visual Studio project. The game can then be built and run from Visual Studio.
